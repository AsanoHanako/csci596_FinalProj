# CSCI596 Final Project
## Description
We have already practiced in molecular dynamics animation to visualize the simulated movement of the atoms. However the result we got so far is not so intuitive yet as the atoms aggregated there are not to be easily distinguished. As an extension of the assignment, I plan to use openGL to add a visual effect to the atoms with their corresponding kinetic energy, such that the exchange in energy during the thermal motion can be better displayed.
